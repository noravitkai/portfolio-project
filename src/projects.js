      "A modern, minimalist website for an annual academic conference, built with Tailwind CSS and Vanilla JavaScript on WordPress.",
    descriptions: [
      "The project involved developing a new website along with other digital media products for Fiatalok Konferenciája (FiKon), an annual Hungarian conference organized by university students.",
      "FiKon plays a vital role in fostering academic exchange by providing a platform for Bachelor’s, Master’s, and PhD students specializing in Medieval and Early Modern Literary and Cultural Studies to present their research findings. Although FiKon has been successfully operating for a decade, its online presence lacked the sophistication needed to adequately reflect its mission and attract potential participants.",
      "Addressing the deficiencies in FiKon’s web presence was the goal of the project, achieved by creating a user-friendly and visually appealing website, complemented by a cohesive brand identity through various digital media products.",
      "The development of the website involved a blend of modern web dev technologies and frameworks for a seamless, high-performance experience. While the site is built on the WordPress platform for its content management capabilities, a custom-coded unique theme was developed to meet specific needs. Custom theme development offers several key benefits, including consistency with the brand identity, great flexibility and tailored functionality, as well as better performance with a more efficient, lightweight codebase.",
      "The custom theme was developed using Tailwind CSS for effective and responsive styling, along with Vanilla JavaScript for dynamic interactivity. Tailwind CSS was selected for its utility-first approach to styling, which allows for rapid development and a cohesive design language across the site. Vanilla JavaScript was employed to handle dynamic interactivity for implementing custom functionalities without larger frameworks.",
      "WordPress was chosen primarily for its user-friendly content management system, allowing conference organizers to easily manage the content of the page without requiring technical knowledge. The language of the site is Hungarian, serving its local audience. The content is populated dynamically using PHP and WordPress functions.",

My role was to integrate all the provided information and visuals into a cohesive and engaging promotional website.",
      "The landing page was developed using Vue.js and Tailwind CSS. Vue.js enabled a fast, interactive user experience with its component-based architecture, while Tailwind CSS supported the creation of a responsive and visually appealing layout, enhancing user engagement.",
      "The website, in Hungarian to serve its target group, features strategic elements such as CTA sections, service descriptions, information on how HUFBAU Piedl supports customers through the Home Renovation Programme, and details about the prize draw associated with the campaign.",
